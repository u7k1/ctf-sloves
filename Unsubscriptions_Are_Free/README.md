This repository contains the solution to the "Unsubscriptions Are Free" challenge from picoCTF.
[Challenge Link](https://play.picoctf.org/practice/challenge/187)

### Solution Overview
- The `exploit.py` solves the local version of the challenge by interacting with a local process or binary.
- The `exploit_REMOTE.py` solves the remote version of the challenge by connecting to the remote server and exploiting the vulnerability.

### Notes
- If the exploit fails on the first attempt, try running the script again.
- Modify the scripts to fit your environment if necessary (IP address, port).
